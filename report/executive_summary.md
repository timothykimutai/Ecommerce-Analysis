## Finding 1: At-Risk High-Value Customers

### The Trend
**334 customers (7.7%)** are classified as At-Risk—high spenders who haven't purchased in over 144 days on average. These customers previously generated **£2,477** per customer on average, representing significant revenue at risk.

### The Root Cause
Analysis reveals At-Risk customers have an **8.6x higher item return rate** (17.89% vs 2.07% for Champions), indicating quality or fulfillment issues drove them away. Additionally, these customers explored **28% fewer unique products** (2,687 vs 3,440), suggesting limited product discovery or narrow catalog appeal.

### The Solution
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Immediate Actions (0-30 days)**

1. **Quality Audit**: Investigate the 59 products purchased exclusively by At-Risk customers, starting with "TEA TIME TEA TOWELS" (£6,045 revenue). These may have quality issues.

2. **Win-Back Campaign**: Launch targeted email campaign offering:
   - 20% discount on top Champion products they haven't tried (e.g., "REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER", "JUMBO BAG RED RETROSPOT")
   - Free returns guarantee to rebuild trust
   - Personalized product recommendations based on their purchase history

3. **Pause Risky Promotions**: Temporarily halt marketing spend on products with high At-Risk concentration until quality is verified.

> [!TIP]
> **Medium-Term Strategy (30-90 days)**

4. **Product Discovery Enhancement**: Implement personalized recommendations to increase product diversity exposure for all customers.

5. **Return Root Cause Analysis**: Deep-dive into the 89,129 items returned by At-Risk customers to identify specific quality issues.

## Finding 2: Champion Customer Characteristics

### The Trend
**548 Champions (12.6%)** drive disproportionate value with an average spend of **£7,782** per customer and purchase frequency of **13.7 orders**. They maintain a recent engagement (5.7 days since last purchase).

### Success Factors
- **Low return rate**: Only 2.07% item return rate indicates high satisfaction
- **Product diversity**: Explore 3,440 unique products, 28% more than At-Risk
- **Consistent engagement**: Purchase every 5-6 days on average

### The Solution
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Retention Strategy**

1. **VIP Program**: Create exclusive loyalty tier for Champions with:
   - Early access to new products
   - Dedicated customer service line
   - Quarterly appreciation gifts

2. **Referral Incentives**: Leverage Champions as brand ambassadors with referral bonuses (they're already satisfied).

3. **Protect the Base**: Monitor Champion segment weekly for any decline in engagement metrics.

## Finding 3: New Customer Conversion Opportunity

### The Trend
**242 New Customers (5.6%)** made their first purchase recently (19 days ago on average) with low basket values (£349). They have the **lowest return rate** (9.50% orders, 0.77% items), indicating good initial experiences.

### The Opportunity
These customers are in a critical conversion window. Their low return rates suggest satisfaction, but they need nurturing to become repeat buyers.

### The Solution
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Conversion Campaign (14-30 days post-purchase)**

1. **Second Purchase Incentive**: Offer 15% discount on their second order within 30 days.

2. **Educational Content**: Send product guides and use-case content to increase engagement.

3. **Cross-Sell Strategy**: Recommend complementary products based on their first purchase.
